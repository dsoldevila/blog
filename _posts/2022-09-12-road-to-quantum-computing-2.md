It's been a month since I started my Quantum Mechanics journey. On one hand I'm happy because I managed to be more or less constant with my learning (although it has been hard to work on this 5 days a week) and I think I've been able to move forward with my learning. On the other hand it has been a disaster, in the previous post I expected that:

_As you can see, I estimated the **Feymman lectures on physics Vol III** to take me more or less 2 months (from August to October). Rounding up the numbers: The book is almost 300 pages, which, in ~8 weeks, it means 38 pages per week, which means 8 pages a day or 8 pages per hour (I set a goal of 1 hour a day). **It seems achievable, but I will keep an eye on the progress.**_

I don't have the numbers, but I think I managed to read 8 pages.. a week! Mainly because I thought I had the minimum knowledge to read the book, but I don't really do. It requires a certain knowledge on waves that I do not have, so I spend a lot of time re-reading and searching for explanations elsewhere, mainly on the Internet.


## Next steps

To overcome these problems, I decided to:
* Pause my reading of **Feymman lectures on physics Vol III**
* Focus on **Classical Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum**, which seems to be a better start point for me (I was reading it parallely and it's been more accessible and less frustrating)
* Read some chapters of **Feymman lectures on physics Vol I** about waves that are explictely referenced in **Vol III**.
* Instead of spending 1 hour a day 5 days a week, spend 1h30 a day 4  a week.
* (Optional) Take a look at [Standford's MOOC course on Quantum Mechanics for Engineers](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-mechanics-for-scientists-and-engineers-1).


## Goals

So my next goal will be to finish **Classical Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum** by the end of October. With a raugh estimate, that means less that 5 pages a day. Let's see if I can manage to achieve this goal.
