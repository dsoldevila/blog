A couple of weeks ago I decided that I wanted to do a Master on Quantum Computing. In fact, I've been thinking about it for quite a bit, but I have finally decided that I want to. My main handicap is that I don't know almost anything about Quantum Mechanics, an obvious requirement to do a Master in Quantum Computing. In high school I enjoyed physics, but I ended up doing a degree in Computer Science. It's been 3 years since I graduated so currently I'm a Computer Enginner with 3 years of experience and rusty mathematics...

My main reason to write this is to analyze HOW I'm learning quantum mechanics, that it to say, my learnign methodology. I want to learn things fast AND reliably. Maybe I will also use this blog to settle down new knowledge, that is to say, WHAT I'm learning: the best way to learn things is by trying to explain them.

By the way, to learn tips on how to learn better, I recommend you _Learning like a pro_ by Barbara Oakley. There is also a well famous free MOC called _Learning how to learn_ by the same Author.


## Goals

The first thing is to have a clear goal on what I'm about to do. For me, this goal is to be able to attend a master in quantum computing. However, this goal is too generic, it serves its purpose of "direction" (where I want to go), of bigger picture, but it does not tell how I will know if I'm ready in the first place.

For this we need some **mid-level goals**. For me these goals are books. Searching on the internet about how to learn quantum mechanics, I encountered this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs572Cf4zkk), which is the first one you get when you search for _how to learn quantum mechanics_. It recommends some books to learn the subject and I bought some of them. As I do not know Quantum Mechanics, I have no criteria, but the video seemed reliable and it did not tell anything out of place in comparison with other places.

So, my **mid-level goals** are finishing and understanding the following books:
* **Feymann lectures on physics Vol III**
  * along with the exercise book)
* **Introduction to linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang**
  * I had a linear algebra course in college, but I'm a bit rusty and the course was sub-par.
* **Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum**
* **A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics by John S. Townsend**

I also bought **Classical Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum** to revisit some stuff, but I don't really know if it's necessary. It's not going to hurt, though.

However, we are not finished. Goals must be not only specific but also time-limited. Here comes into play the **low-level goals**, the day-to-day objectives. I decided my low-level goal to be to study 5 hours a week (I'll revisit this in some weeks to see if it's enough or not)

So, with this info I created the following planing:

As you can see, I estimated the **Feymman lectures on physics Vol III** to take me more or less 2 months (from August to October). Rounding up the numbers: The book is almost 300 pages, which, in ~8 weeks, it means 38 pages per week, which means 8 pages a day or 8 pages per hour (I set a goal of 1 hour a day). **It seems achievable, but I will keep an eye on the progress.**


Finally, the master has other requirements, such as **statistical physics**, but I decided to focus on quantum mechanics only for the moment.
